            "Implicit Bias" is a term that names the attitudes and stereotypes that can subconsciously shape one's
            thoughts, actions, and decisions without even realizing it. Whether the associations someone holds are
            positive or negative, every single person is susceptible to having implicit biases. These biases can be best
            understood by approaching them with an "intersectional" framework.

            intersectionality helps us understand how different identities and experiences overlap.
