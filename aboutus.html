        <p>
            I am a part-time student in my final year of the iSchool program! I currently live in Chicago with my
            partner and our two cats - Twiggy and Cat Stevens. My background is in Art History and I love spending time
            at the Art Institute here in the city. My current role is working full-time for DePaul University's Library
            as the Loanable Technology Circulation Supervisor, where I oversee our Circulation Desk, equipment, and
            student workers.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my free time, I mostly cook (I *love* getting my hands on a new cookbook to experiment with), read and
            watch horror media, and develop perfume. That last hobby is my newest in recent years, and I am currently
            enrolled in courses from the Institute of Art & Olafaction. Suprisingly, there are several folks with
            library backgrounds in my cohort!
