        <a href="https://ncwit.org/profile/kimberly-bryant/">Kimberly Bryant</a> was our choice for a tech hero that is actively providing leadership in advancing racial equity

        <a href="https://www.wearebgc.org/">Black Girls Code</a>, not to be confused with the similarly named Girls Who Code, was born out of Bryant's daughter
        expressed an interest in learning computer programming, which was not plausible through the classes and
        workshops offered near where Bryant and her family were living. The focus became introducing Black girls aged 7-17 to the field of technology and programming. In the 10+ years of its existence, Bryant has
        recieved numerous awards and commendations for Black Girls Code and the organization's impact on increasing
        access to coding and STEM resources to Black women.
