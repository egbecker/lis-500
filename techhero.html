            <a href="https://ncwit.org/profile/kimberly-bryant/">Kimberly Bryant</a> was our choice for a tech hero that
            is actively providing leadership in advancing racial equity because of her creation of the nonprofit
            organization, Black Girls Code in 2011. Bryant's background is in electrical engineering, which she holds a
            degree in from Vanderbuilt University, as well as biotechnology. She was named one of the
            <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/most-influential-blacks-in-technology-2013-4"
                >"25 Most Influential African-Americans In Technology"</a
            >
            by Business Insider in 2013. Additionally, Bryant was a keynote speaker in the 2021 South by Southwest
            (SXSW) in the education division.

            <a href="https://www.wearebgc.org/">Black Girls Code</a>, not to be confused with the similarly named Girls
            Who Code, was born out of Bryant's daughter expressed an interest in learning computer programming, which
            was not plausible through the classes and workshops offered near where Bryant and her family were living.
            The focus became introducing Black girls aged 7-17 to the field of technology and programming. In the 10+
            years of its existence, Bryant has recieved numerous awards and commendations for Black Girls Code and the
            organization's impact on increasing access to coding and STEM resources to Black women.

           <a href="https://www.dair-institute.org/team/">Timnit Gebru</a> was chosen as a tech hero for her dedication to
		   promoting professional and institutional ethics,inclusion, and transparency in technology. In 2021, she and 
		   <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/rediet-abebe-tackles-inequality-with-computer-science-20210401/">Rediet Abebe</a>
		   co-founded Black in AI, an organization to promote the inclusion of black people in the field of Artificial Intelligence. 
		   Gebru received her PhD from Stamford University in Computer Vision in 2017. As early as her time at Stamford
		   she worked on an unpublished paper that warned of the potential dangers of AI.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2018, Gebru joined Google to co-lead a team on the ethics of artificial intelligence with Margaret Mitchell. 
			During this time, she co-authored the paper <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922">"On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big? ðŸ¦œ"</a>.  
			The paper laid out the risks of large language models in AI, which so happens, is a technology Google AI is heavily reliant upon. In 2020,
			Google asked that Gebru withdraw the paper from publication or to remove the names of all Google employees from it.
			When Gebru refused <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/12/04/1013294/google-ai-ethics-research-paper-forced-out-timnit-gebru/">
			she was terminated from her position at Google</a>. Since then Gebru has continued to fight for inclusion, diversity, and equity in
			technology with both Black in AI and <a href="https://www.dair-institute.org/">DAIR, the Distributed AI Research Institute</a>.
