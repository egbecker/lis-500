            <a href="https://ncwit.org/profile/kimberly-bryant/">Kimberly Bryant</a> was our first choice for a
            compelling tech hero due to her unwavering commitment to advancing equity for Black women and girls in the
            United States. As the founder of Black Girls CODE, she has created vital pathways for young women of color
            to enter and thrive in the tech industry, addressing the significant underrepresentation of these groups in
            STEM fields. Bryantâ€™s work not only empowers girls through coding workshops and mentorship programs but also
            advocates for broader systemic change within the tech ecosystem. By highlighting the importance of diversity
            and inclusion, she challenges industry norms and inspires a new generation of innovators. Her leadership
            exemplifies the transformative power of technology when it is accessible to all, making her a pivotal figure
            in the movement toward equity in tech. Bryant's background is in electrical engineering, which she holds a
            degree in from Vanderbuilt University, as well as biotechnology. She was named one of the
            <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/most-influential-blacks-in-technology-2013-4"
                >"25 Most Influential African-Americans In Technology"</a
            >
            by Business Insider in 2013. Additionally, Bryant was a keynote speaker in the 2021 South by Southwest
            (SXSW) in the education division.

            which was not plausible through the classes and workshops offered near where Bryant and her family were
            living. The focus became introducing Black girls aged 7-17 to the field of technology and programming. In
            the 10+ years of its existence, Bryant has recieved numerous awards and commendations for Black Girls Code
            and the organization's impact on increasing access to coding and STEM resources to Black women.

            <a href="https://www.dair-institute.org/team/">Timnit Gebru</a> was chosen as our second tech hero for her
            dedication to promoting professional and institutional ethics, inclusion, and transparency in technology. In
            2021, she and
            <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/rediet-abebe-tackles-inequality-with-computer-science-20210401/"

            >
            co-founded Black in AI, an organization to promote the inclusion of black people in the field of Artificial
            Intelligence. Gebru received her PhD from Stamford University in Computer Vision in 2017. As early as her
            time at Stamford she worked on an unpublished paper that warned of the potential dangers of AI.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2018, Gebru joined Google to co-lead a team on the ethics of artificial intelligence with Margaret
            Mitchell. During this time, she co-authored the paper
            <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922"
                >"On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big? ðŸ¦œ"</a
            >. The paper laid out the risks of large language models in AI, which so happens, is a technology Google AI
            is heavily reliant upon. In 2020, Google asked that Gebru withdraw the paper from publication or to remove
            the names of all Google employees from it. When Gebru refused

                she was terminated from her position at Google</a
            >. Since then Gebru has continued to fight for inclusion, diversity, and equity in technology with both
            Black in AI and <a href="https://www.dair-institute.org/">DAIR, the Distributed AI Research Institute</a>.
