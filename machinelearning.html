        <h1>Machine Learning</h1>
        <p>
            Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves training computer algorithms
            to recognize patterns and make data-driven predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. At
            its core, ML enables systems to learn from past experiences, improving their performance over time as they
            process more data.
        </p>
        <p>
            The process begins with data collection, where raw datasets are gathered and prepared for analysis. This
            step often includes cleaning the data to remove errors, inconsistencies, or irrelevant information. The next
            step is feature selection, where key variables or attributes in the dataset are chosen to enhance model
            accuracy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the data is prepared, an ML algorithm is selected based on the problem type, such as classification,
            regression, or clustering. Algorithms like decision trees, neural networks, or support vector machines are
            then trained using a portion of the dataset, enabling them to identify relationships within the data.
        </p>
        <p>
            During training, the algorithm adjusts its parameters to minimize errors, improving its predictive
            performance. After training, the model is validated and tested with new data to ensure reliability and
            generalization. Finally, the model can be deployed to make real-world predictions or decisions, with its
            performance monitored over time for continuous improvement.

        <h1>Our Project Statements</h1>
        <h2>Liz's Statement</h2>
        <p>
            Machine learning, a rapidly advancing branch of artificial intelligence, has captured the imagination of
            technologists and the general public alike. However, the foundational concepts behind AI can often seem out
            of reach for those without a technical background. Google's Teachable Machines platform bridges this gap,
            empowering anyone with basic web development skills and a creative mindset to understand and experiment with
            machine learning. For this project, we embarked on a journey to design and implement a machine learning
            algorithm, integrate it into a functional webpage, and critically reflect on our work's ethical and societal
            implications, inspired by Joy Buolamwini's <i>Unmasking AI</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project was not just about theory; it was about hands-on experimentation and practical learning. By
            following the structured tutorial provided by Teachable Machines, David and I gained the practical skills to
            create and deploy an algorithm capable of classifying images or recognizing voices. We started by training
            the algorithm using a custom dataset. Using a simple webcam setup, we captured examples of the categories we
            wanted the machine to distinguish, ensuring the dataset was varied enough to provide robust training while
            remaining manageable within the constraints of the project. After training the model, we exported it and
            integrated it into a custom webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Our completed webpage serves as both a
            demonstration of the algorithm in action and a reflection of our learning journey. Visitors to the page can
            interact with the trained model and observe how it classifies inputs in real-time. We embedded a video
            showcasing the algorithm's development and operation to complement this interactive element.
        </p>
        <p>
            As we worked through this project, the critical themes in <i>Unmasking AI</i> provided a vital lens for
            evaluating our work. Buolamwini's emphasis on bias in AI systems was particularly resonant. No matter how
            advanced, machine learning models are only as unbiased as the data they are trained on. Datasets can
            inadvertently reflect the prejudices and inequalities of the natural world, leading to algorithms that
            perpetuate these issues. This awareness led us to evaluate the dataset we created carefully. We aimed to
            include many examples to ensure the model was as inclusive and representative as possible. However, we
            recognized that true inclusivity requires ongoing vigilance, feedback, and refinement, emphasizing the
            importance of iterative development in AI design.
        </p>
        <p>
            Buolamwini's call for ethical responsibility in AI development also prompted us to reflect on the broader
            implications of our work. While this project is a relatively small-scale exercise, it mirrors the challenges
            of larger AI systems deployed worldwide. For example, even though our algorithm operates in a controlled
            environment, questions about its potential misuse, limitations, and design assumptions remained central to
            our discussions. These reflections deepened our understanding of the need for transparency and
            accountability in AI development, reassuring us and the audience of the responsible future of technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            The collaborative nature of this project added another layer of richness to the experience. Working as a
            group required us to navigate different perspectives, skills, and approaches to problem-solving. Both David
            and I brought unique strengths, from technical proficiency in coding to creative ideas for presenting the
            project on the webpage. This diversity of thought enhanced the quality of our work and mirrored the
            multidisciplinary approach that successful AI development often requires. Our collaboration underscored the
            importance of communication, adaptability, and shared responsibility, all essential skills in both academic
            and professional contexts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another significant aspect of this project was the integration of creativity with technical implementation.
            Designing the algorithm and building the webpage required analytical thinking and artistic expression.
            Decisions about the webpage's layout, color scheme, and user experience were just as important as the
            technical accuracy of the algorithm itself. This interplay between creativity and technology highlighted the
            potential for AI to be a tool for solving problems and enabling new forms of artistic and cultural
            expression.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project was not just about our own learning and development; it was also about contributing to the
            broader community of learners and developers. By uploading our code to GitHub and documenting our process,
            we made a significant contribution to the open-source ecosystem. Our work is now available for others to
            learn from and build upon, aligning with the ethos of transparency and collaboration that Buolamwini
            advocates for. This project is a testament to our belief that AI development should be inclusive and
            participatory.
        </p>
        <p>
            The final stages of the project, including soliciting feedback and making iterative improvements,
            underscored the value of continual learning and refinement. Feedback from peers and instructors provided
            fresh perspectives on our work, revealing blind spots we had overlooked and suggesting ways to enhance the
            project's functionality and presentation. These iterative cycles of development and critique mirrored the
            real-world processes of AI research and development, where no system is ever truly finished, and improvement
            is a constant goal. This commitment to improvement should motivate and inspire all of us in the field of AI.
        </p>
        <p>
            In reflecting on the entire experience, several vital lessons emerge. First, machine learning is more opaque
            than it often seems; with the right tools and guidance, anyone can understand and experiment with it.
            Second, creating and deploying an algorithm is more about ethical considerations than technical precision.
            Buolamwini's work reminded us that every choice we make in designing an AI system carries implications for
            its fairness, inclusivity, and impact on society. Finally, this project's collaborative and creative aspects
            underscored the importance of bringing diverse perspectives and disciplines together to tackle complex
            challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project represents a convergence of technical skills, ethical inquiry, and creative exploration. It is
            a testament to the power of accessible tools like Teachable Machines to democratize AI and empower
            individuals to engage with technology in meaningful ways. As we move forward, the lessons learned from this
            project will continue to inform our approach to AI, reminding us of the importance of curiosity,
            responsibility, and collaboration in shaping the future of technology.
